In 2011, Pusha T launched "Don't Fuck With Me," weaving in elements from Drake's "Dreams Money Can Buy"â€”a track containing veiled barbs aimed at Pusha. At the same time, Drake and Lil Wayne were launching verbal salvos at Kanye West and Jay-Z. Pusha T appeared to strike back in his song with a pointed jab: "Rappers on their sophomores / Acting like they boss lords."
