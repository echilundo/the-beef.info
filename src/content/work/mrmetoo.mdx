Wayne still sported Billionaire Boys Club in his “Hustler Muzik” video and was featured wearing BAPE on the cover of VIBE in 2006—a move that raised eyebrows, given that Pharrell had been a long-time advocate for the brand. The release of “Mr. Me Too” by Pusha T and Malice, featuring Pharrell, was perceived as a pointed critique of those copying their distinctive style, subtly targeting Wayne. Wayne retaliated in a 2006 Complex interview, asserting that he was the trendsetter for BAPE, not Pharrell.
