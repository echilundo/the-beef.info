“Control” is a braggadocious attempt to revitalize the competitive spirit of the rap game.

Kendrick Lamar sent shockwaves across the internet with his verse that name-drops and takes no prisoners. His bold claims and aggressive spitting led to an onslaught of response tracks and interviews from rappers looking to prove themselves or inspired to step up their game. - From Genius
